1. Worked on updateProduct branch
2. I implemented parition input testing, boundary testing, and decision table testing to ensure
the code runs smoothly. 
3. I found it difficult to do boundary testing for properties such as descipriotn as the maximum length is 2000 charchters. 
4. Will create more test cases as more features are implemented. I will also comment my test cases.
