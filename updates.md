1. Working on frontend implementation for purchasing a product.
2. Completed majority of it, just need to wait for backend so I can know what arguments to pass into the purchase product function.
3. was quite unsure whether I'd put purchasing the product within login or on it's own page. decided to make it's own page, and user has to select their username.
4. just need to wait for function name & arguments.

1. Working on backend testing for purchasing a product.
2. Waiting for the backend development to finish before I can start
the backend testing.
3. None at the moment!
4. As soon as backend development is done, I will complete the testing function.
It should not take too long so then Leo can start the security testing soon too.
